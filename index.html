  <p>The 20-year-old continued to impress for Delhi and dominated attacks,
    clearly demonstrating that he belonged at a much higher level; that
    junior cricket was beneath his standards. Kohli then traveled to Australia
    in 2009 for the Emerging players tournament and stamped his authority all
    over the bowling attacks.He added 'big-match temperament' to his résumé too,
    lacing a fluent hundred in the final against South Africa, and guiding his
    team to aclinical victory. The young prodigy, barely old enough to receive his
    man-of-the-match champagne, ended the tournament with 398 runs from 7 outings
    with two centuries and two fifties, ensuring that he remained fresh in the selectors' minds.
